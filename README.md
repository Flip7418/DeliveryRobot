## Project
Help me, robot

## Alternatives / Market research


There are many delivery robots, but we focus on our university. We want our robot to deliver medicines and take care of our students. Of course, there are such multi-functional robots that not only make deliveries, but it is important for us that our robot monitors the condition of students, provides first aid and, most importantly, works 24/7. 

Also, all information about students and the state of the robot and its location is tracked on the corporate website. This site will have all students on the university base and will immediately receive help. Students' illnesses will be reported to the medical staff of the university. 

In addition, you can see on the site how to provide first aid, read the description of the pills, about the disease and the history of their diseases. In addition, the status of the robot will be delivered to the admin of the robot and, if necessary, it will undergo technical inspection. 

This idea is not yet so popular in Kazakhstan and therefore we believe that it will be in demand in our market. And we are paying attention to the availability of materials and will try to make further parts from scrap metal provided by the university.

## Non-Functional requirements
1. The application must have easy usability. 
2. The application must be must be durable.
3. The application functionality should be updated periodically.

## Risks
1. It may bring the wrong medicine, if size of box will be equal.
2. It may get stuck and run out of charge or it may be knocked down by students, cause in university we had many stairs.
3. Also there should be stable wi-fi connection, cause it requires constant monitoring.

## Future iterations
