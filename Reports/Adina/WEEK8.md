# Report for week 8
* This week we've been doing more with the robot part. We have soldered the parts to our robot. They also wrote the code.
* My part was to make a motion sensor for the robot.  So that he could determine some movements nearby and also how many centimeters to the object side by side and next to any object. So that he bypasses them.
