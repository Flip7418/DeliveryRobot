# REPORT 11

# Robotics part:
*We have been working with the body for the robot. We discussed with Ilyas what the 3d model robot will look like. Since we changed the previous model of the robot so that it does not fall due to heavy weight or so that it does not brake and does not roll over . We have printed out a 3D model of the robot. We will also continue to print some more .
# Backend part:
* Understand and study the information as the robot will drive through various obstacles, identify the stop signs
