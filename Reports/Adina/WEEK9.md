# Report for week 9
* This week we have been working with the body for the robot. We discussed with Ilyas what the building will look like. Since we changed the previous model of the robot so that it does not fall due to heavy weight or so that it does not brake and does not roll over . We have printed out a 3D model of the robot. We will also continue to print some more .
