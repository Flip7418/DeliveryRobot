# week 5
* In week 5, we discussed a lot about the graduation project.
* We discussed the website design and colors as well as the technical details of the robot.We filled out the plans of each participant.Each participant will have their own tasks that they must complete in a week.
Once a week we hold a rally with everyone, and usually we shoot a video. And we also created a list of spare parts that we should order (or as you can say) such as raspberry pi , servo tester and so on.
