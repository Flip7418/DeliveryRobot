* GULP
  
  I made assembly of gulp in visual studio, for coding in scss, also it will made easier for dividing tasks in frontend, cause we will able to connect different scss and html parts. 
  
* Minimization

  In addition, i tuned additional plugins like webpack, webp and etc, for minimize the weight of files and code.

* Header and design

  I started coding adaptive header and discussed with teamates about created design, we made some correction and new ideas.
