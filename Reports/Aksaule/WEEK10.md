# Backend of site
* I'm doing robot tasks right now and I don't have time to do backend tasks and since we have a tempade front and I need a full frontend to do the backend.
# Robot
* I wrote code for identifying obstacles with the camera connection, the logic is that each time the camera takes a photo and using several filters determines the floor from the surface and identifies what are the obstacles.
