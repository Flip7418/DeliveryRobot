# Backend of site
* I'm doing robot tasks right now and I don't have time to do backend tasks and since we have a tempade front and I need a full frontend to do the backend.
# Robot
* I added the code of the camera and ultrasounds and robot movement to the general code, I adapted everything and everything seems to work correctly.
