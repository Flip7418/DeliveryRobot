# Backend of site
* I'm doing robot tasks right now and I don't have time to do backend tasks and since we have a tempade front and I need a full frontend to do the backend.
# Robot
* I talked to the teacher about the robot and he told me to make a smaller robot so that it would stop faster, so my team and I decided to make a smaller robot and we started to work on it. 
* I made the code and the physical part of the robot and now our robot can go straight, turn left, turn right, and stop.
* On Saturday, Adina and I soldered parts to the robot and assembled it from scratch.
